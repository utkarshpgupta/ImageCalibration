# ImageCalibration
Matlab demo for camera calibration.

Using any image this program can calculate where the camera was positioned while taking the picture. 

This version was built up on the Camera calibration on [Matlab Central](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73079-calibrate-camera-with-one-photo-linear), which improves upon the code and adds an undo functionality to the program for ease of use. 

The method used to calculate the position is called Trai's Calibration method.
